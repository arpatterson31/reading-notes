# Git
What is Git?  
*Git is a distributed version-control system that tracks changes, or commits, in files used by coders during software development.*  

### Perks 
+ All changes are tracked - easy to detect file corruption or loss of infromation
+ Minimize the loss of data
+ Operation benefit - stored on local disk and not a server

### States 
Files in Git fall under 3 main states:
+ Committed - data is stored to database
+ Modified - changed but not committed
+ Staged - flagged to be committed in next round
