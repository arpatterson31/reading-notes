## CSS Positioning

### Relative Positioning
  - shifts element to Top, Left, Right, or bottom of where it was originally placed

To write it in CSS:

`position: relative;`

then use the offset properties (top or bottom & left or right) to indicate how far to move the element from where it would have been in normal flow

`top: 10px;`
`left: 100px;`


### Absolute Positioning
  - positions the element in relation to its containing element


### Fixed Positioning
  - positions the element in relation to the browser window


### Floating Elements
  - takes it out of its normal position and moves it to the far right or far left
