# Class Reading - Stacks and Queues

## Vocab terms and things I have learned

- **Stack:** A data structure. It is a sequence of `nodes` that are linked to each other. Each Node reference the next but does not reference its previous
  - inserts and deletes can happen only at the top!

- **Queue:** very similar to stack except you can only add to the end of the queue and remove from the front of the list

- **FILO:** - First in, last out - used by Stacks
- **LIFO:** - Last in, First out - used by Stacks

- **FIFO:** - First In, First Out - used by Queues
- **LILO:** - Last In, Last Out - used by Queues

## Other randoms that I learned

- I feel like Stacks and Queues are going to be easier to grasp more than linked-lists!
- Stacks have pop and push functions like arrays, but they are not the same!
