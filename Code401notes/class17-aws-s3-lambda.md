# Class 17 Reading: AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Describe the Cloud

- "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines. *[source](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-the-cloud/)*

### What is a container(as it relates to computers and servers)?

- A container 'contains' both an application and all the elements the application needs to run properly, including system libraries, system settings, and other dependencies. *[source](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-vs-containers/)*

### What is auto-scaling?

- A method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm. *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling)*

### What is bandwidth?

- the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. Bandwidth may be characterized as network bandwidth, data bandwidth, or digital bandwidth. *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing))*

### How do cloud providers compute service costs?

- Containers are constantly running, and therefore cloud providers have to charge for the server space even if no one is using the application at the time.
- There are no continued expenses in a serverless architecture because application code does not run unless it is called. Instead, developers are only charged for the server capacity that their application does in fact use. *[source](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-vs-containers/)*

## Document the following vocab words

- **Server Instances:** a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. The instances are not linked with each other and can be controlled or managed separately. *[source](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32149/server-instance#:~:text=A%20server%20instance%20is%20a,based%20or%20command%2Dline%20based.)*
- **Containers:** application and all the elements the application needs to run properly, including system libraries, system settings, and other dependencies. *[source](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-vs-containers/)*
- **Cloud Services:** wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. *[source](https://www.citrix.com/glossary/what-is-a-cloud-service.html#:~:text=The%20term%20%22cloud%20services%22%20refers,for%20internal%20infrastructure%20or%20hardware.)*
- **Cloud Architecture:** the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing, typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue. Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others. *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Architecture)*
- **AWS:** Amazon web services
- **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku:** Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, solutions (production configurations) is that they have comparable features and pricing. One big difference is that Herokuâ€™s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve. *[source](https://codeburst.io/heroku-v-s-aws-elastic-beanstalk-1cc6f12ca3c7)*

## Preview

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- I've heard of CND and have used in the past on code fellow projects. I have heard of AWS but are not aware of their S3 or Lambda products

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I'm hoping that we dive pretty deep into the different AWS services. It would be a good benefit for me to understand how these things work as I try to enter the industy.

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- Any of the AWS stuff!
