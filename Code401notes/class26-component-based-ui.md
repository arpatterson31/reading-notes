## Preview

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- I took the 301 Class with the new React curriculum so I am familiar with React, JSX (way to write javascript in react) and rendering elements

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I am not that familiar with SASS so I'd be excited to see and learn more about that

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- SASS and learning about these other componentMount functions...I only used ComponentDidMount and ComponentWillMount in 301
