# Class 04 Reading: Data Modeling

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Name 3 advantages to TDD

- It will help you map out how your code needs to look
- higer code quality
- code flexibility and easier maintenance

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- when you are having the test create and add data to a db and to test if it was added to the database. you'll want to use these so you can create it then delete it after the test

### What is one downside of TDD?

- tests need to be maintained when requirements changes *[source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-test-driven-development-tdd/)*

### Whats the primary diff between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

- The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance *[source](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/es6-class-chaos-keeps-js-developer-up#:~:text=Prototypes%20vs.,is%20itself%20an%20object%20instance.&text=A%20constructor%20in%20JavaScript%20is,function%20that%20returns%20an%20object.)*

### Why REST?

- One of the key advantages of REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia. This flexibility allows developers to build an API that meets your needs while also meeting the needs of very diverse customers. *[source](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20key%20advantages,the%20correct%20implementation%20of%20hypermedia.)*

## Document the following vocab words

- **functional programming:** process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. *[source](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-functional-programming-7f218c68b3a0)*
- **object-oriented programming:** programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. *[source](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)*
- **class:** abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects *[source](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)*
- **super:** used to call props on a from a parent constructor
- **this:** JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to *[source](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)*
- **Test Driven Development:** software development practice enabling developers to create proper specifications about how their code should be written and implemented *[source](https://www.codica.com/blog/test-driven-development-benefits/)*
- **jest:** framework used for testing
- **continuous integration:** the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)*
- **REST:** Representational state transfer is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)*
- **Data Model:** organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model)*

## Preview

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- I'm getting more clarity on the nosql because I've used mongodb on 2 projects in 301

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- a deeper dive into mongo and other nosql examples

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- I would like to learn a little more about sql because I have no idea about how that works, but I'm assuming we won't be learning that in 401..just working more on nosql
