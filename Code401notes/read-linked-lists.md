# Class Reading: Linked Lists

## Vocab terms and things I have learned

- **Linked List:** A data structure and a cousin to an array. It is a sequence of `nodes` that are linked to each other. And there are 2 types: Singly and Doubly

- **Linear data structures:** - sequence and an order in how data structures are constructed and traversed - sequentially

- **Non-linear data structures:** - all over the place! don't have to be traversed or constructed sequentially because nodes could be connected to several nodes

- **Big O:** a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.

- **O(1):** doesn't matter how many elements or huge the input, it will always take the same amount of time and memory to run the algorithm

- **O(n):** input grows the space and time that is needed to run the algorithm

## Other randoms that I learned

- Linked Lists have heads that you always start at
- Last node in the linked list references null and kills your traversal
- You want to be aware of how your algorithm performs... is it taking too much time? is it sucking up all the memory???
