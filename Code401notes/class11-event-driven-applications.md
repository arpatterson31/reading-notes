# Class 11 Reading: Event Driven Applications

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Why is access control important?

- It is authentication and identity verfication! it controls who can access routes and make changes to an application

### Describe an application that would need access control?

- an ecommerce site... you'd have admins that could edit products but regular old users of the site shouldn't be able to

### What is a role used for?

- used in ACL middleware so that when a user is signed up they can be verified that they have certain crude abilities on routes.

### Why is a role based acl more scalable than discretionary or mandatory ac?

- RBAC takes more of a real world approach to structuring access control. RBAC assigns permissions to particular roles in an organization. Users are then assigned to that particular role. *[source](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Mandatory,_Discretionary,_Role_and_Rule_Based_Access_Control)*

## Document the following vocab words

- **authorization:** the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization)*
- **role based access control:** an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.. *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)*
- **capabilities:** crud permissions that users can do on certain routes.. like create, read, update, or delete

## Preview

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- I'm familiar with a few of the `event.` methods as I was scrolling through the list. Familiar as I've seen them in example code but haven't implmented them all myself.

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Not sure if these are similar to the event listeners we learned in 201 but seems like it could be similar. So excited to see how that is going to be lectured/demo'd

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- Seeing how this all adds on top of what we already have been building on the backend.
