# Class 36 Reading: Application State with Redux

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### What are the advantages of storing tokens in "cookies" vs "local storage"

- The cookie is not accessible via JavaScript; hence, it is not as vulnerable to XSS attacks as localStorage. *[source](https://dev.to/cotter/localstorage-vs-cookies-all-you-need-to-know-about-storing-jwt-tokens-securely-in-the-front-end-15id)*

### Explain 3rd party cookies

- Third-party cookies are those created by domains other than the one the user is visiting at the time, and are mainly used for tracking and online-advertising purposes. They also allow website owners to provide certain services, such as live chats. *[source](https://clearcode.cc/blog/difference-between-first-party-third-party-cookies/#third-party-cookies)*

### How do pixel tags work?

- Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online. *[source](https://resources.marketingeffectiveness.nielsen.com/blog/cookies-tags-pixels-tracking-customer-engagement)*
