# Class 41 Reading: React Native

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux "Ducks"

- "Ducks" file structure proposes putting all of your Redux-related logic for a given slice into a single file
- RTK follows the ducks pattern and combines reducers, actions, and constants in one file called a slice. Each slice will provide an initial state and a reducer function for an object in store. *[source](https://blog.logrocket.com/smarter-redux-with-redux-toolkit/)*

### What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit

- It allows us to write more efficient code, speed up the development process, and automatically apply the best-recommended practices. It was mainly created to solve the THREE MAJOR ISSUES with Redux:
  - Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
  - Have to add a lot of packages to build a large scale application
  - Redux requires too much boilerplate code which makes it cumbersome to write efficient and clean code. *[source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-redux-toolkit-and-why-it-is-more-preferred/)*

## Document the following vocab words

- **redux toolkit slices:** A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. *[source](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice)*
- **namespace:** In computing, a namespace is a set of signs (names) that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily identified. *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace)*

## Preview

- I know react native is mainly for mobile but I haven't had any past experience with it.

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- I am excited to learn React Native for sure and anything else related to mobile frameworks

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- React native and expo
