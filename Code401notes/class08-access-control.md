# Class 08 Reading: Access Control (ACL)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

### When is Basic Auhtorization used vs Bearer Authorization?

- Basic Auth
  - Allows you to access the API directly with your credential : user/password
  - Use Case: integration with reporting tools like PowerBI, Tableau, QLik

- Bearer Authorization
  - Use case: Ideal when scripting, when developing external app or when doing integration with external tools

### What does the JSON Web Token Package do?

- You can used the JSON Web Token Package to create a JSON Web Token *[Source](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-the-jsonwebtoken-node-package-to-create-json-web-tokens-e7941ff66e4e)*

### What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

- It is critical that developers never include their client_secret in public (mobile or browser-based) apps. To help developers avoid accidentally doing this, it’s best to make the client secret visually different from the ID. This way when developers copy and paste the ID and secret, it is easy to recognize which is which. Usually using a longer string for the secret is a good way to indicate this, or prefixing the secret with “secret” or “private”.
- If you store the secret in a way that can be displayed later to developers, you should take extra precautions when revealing the secret. A common way to protect the secret is to insert a “re-authorization” prompt when the developer attempts to retrieve the secret.
- Additionally, obscuring the secret on the application detail page until the developer clicks “show” is a good way to prevent accidental leakage of the secret.

## Document the following vocab words

- **encryption:** the process of encoding information *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption)*
- **token:** an object (in software or in hardware) which represents the right to perform some operation *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token)*
- **bearer:**  (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.  *[source](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/)*
- **secret:** known only to the application and the authorization server. *[source](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/#:~:text=Client%20Secret,of%20the%20server%20generating%20it.)*
- **JSON web token:** Internet proposed standard for creating data with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are signed either using a private secret or a public/private key. *[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)*

## Preview

### Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

- RBAC is a new concpet for me. I feel like if I get more real-world examples of it, then maybe I might have heard of it. I'm sure thats usually the case

### Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- How are going to be implmenting this in our labs

### What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- Anything involving the RBAC
