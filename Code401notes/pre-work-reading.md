## Article - How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

*“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.”* — Steve Jobs

- Encountering a problem -- try this!

1. Understand - Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step).
2. Plan - Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!
3. Divide - Do not try to solve one big problem. Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
4. Stuck? - The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

- PRATICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!

- You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

### How to use the 5 whys

1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
