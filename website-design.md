# Website Design 

## Things to consider

 - Who is the site for?
 - Why are they coming to your site?
   - their motivation or goals
 - What information is needed by the visitors?
 - How often will they need to visit?

 - Include a site map! -- this is a diagram of the site structure


## Process 

 - Start with a wireframe - sketch of information and layout of each page
    **not to be included** color scheme, font choice, images
   - focus is on what info needs to be there and the layout
 - Online wireframe tools: gomockingbird.com  lovelycharts.com
