## **Markdown** - its a way to style text on the web
### Why is it used?
 1. Simple (who doesn't like that?)
 2. Easier to read


#### Headers
Use the `#` symbol to create a header. For every # symbol you use, it changes the size of the heading. Max is 6 `#`

 * Using One `#` symbol creates the largest heading
* Using 2 `#` symbols will create a second largest heading and so forth


#### Lists
##### Ordered
To create an ordered list: start each line with a number and a period: `1.`, `2.`, `3.`, etc
##### Unordered or bullet list
To create an unorder or bullet list: start each line with an `*` , a `-`, or a `+`
