## Growth MindSet
Having a *Growth Mindset*, especially during my journey with Code Fellows, is going to help me achieve my career in software development. Having this mindset will help me to believe that my coding skills can be developed through hard work, persistence, and learning through my mistakes.

### Reminders to help me stay in a Growth Mindset
 - Push myself out of my comfort zone
 - Don't take feedback personally - learn from it 
 - Don't be afraid to ask question 
 - YOU GOT THIS!
