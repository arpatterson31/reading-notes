### This is me   

Hi, my name is Audrey! I am from a small town in Michigan, but moved to Seattle when I graduated high school.  In 2018 I became a mother to a little girl. She is awesome, adorable, crazy, and sassy. I wouldn't change her one bit.  I love all things cats, tattoos, and celebrities!

Having a *Growth Mindset*, especially during my journey with Code Fellows, is going to help me achieve my career in software development. Having this mindset will help me to believe that my coding skills can be developed through hard work, persistence, and learning through my mistakes. 


### Remember!
 - Push yourself out of your comfort zone
 - Don't take feedback personally - learn from it 
 - Don't be afraid to ask questions 
 - **YOU GOT THIS!**
