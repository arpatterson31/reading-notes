# JavaScript

- JavaScript is responsible for how the website's content behaves or how the user interacts with it
- JavaScript files are created as a .js file
- Can be written in html but should have own file 
- use ```<script src=></script>``` to link
- Websites still need to be able to work if the user browses with JavaScript turned off

## Statements

- Each step the computer follows in JavaScript is called a statement
- Always end with a ```;```


## Variables

- Stored information from the statements are called variables
- variables can only be used once you declare them or give them a name: ``` var variableName ```
- value of the variable is what information you would like it to store for you 
    -  ``` = ``` means assign in javascript
