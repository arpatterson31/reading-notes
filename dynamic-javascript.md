# JavaScript

- JavaScript is responsible for how the website's content behaves or how the user interacts with it
- JavaScript files are created as a .js file
- Can be written in html but should have own file 
- use ```<script src=></script>``` to link
- Websites still need to be able to work if the user browses with JavaScript turned off
