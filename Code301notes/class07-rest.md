# Readings: REST

## Article - What Google Learned from Its Quest to Build the Perfect team

- I was in 201 and read the article, here are my previous notes on the article

- Having the smartest people doesn't mean that the team will be the best

- I enjoy the team I have built in this class. The few core people that I can collaborate with while in remo has made it easier for me to be productive. We vibe really well together and have been able to connect on more of a personal level. This is something I'm going to be looking for when I come out of this course and start looking for employment. It won't matter how much money I can make, but if I enjoy the team I work on, it will make that much better.

## Article - How I explained REST to my brother

- REST: provides a definition of a "resource" - architectural style the world wide web is built on

- web pages are representation of a resource -- resources are just concepts

- HTTP GET: systems retrieving information from each other
- HTTP POST: one system adding something to another system
- HTTP PUT: system wants to replace something in another system
- HTTP PATCH: partial update
