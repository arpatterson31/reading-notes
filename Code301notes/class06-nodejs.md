## Article - 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

2 heads are better than one!

Involves 2 roles:

- Driver - the one that does all the typing and writing the code
- Navigator - guides driver with thinking of the big picture, what should happen, scans for typos, and does researching and looks up solutions.

Huge perk on pair programming is that builds skills on explaining code out loud, listening to others' guidance, reading code others have written, and writing code themselves.
