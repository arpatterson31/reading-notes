# Readings: Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Article - When Women Stopped Coding

- People who programmed the first digital computers - were WOMEN!

- In the 80's the number of women that were in tech have started to declined
  - this could have been because of the rise of the home computer

## Data - Employee breakdown of key technology companies

- My key take aways from this data:
  - More companies need to step it up and hire females!

  - But I do want to pay this experience at Code Fellows forward to help bring other black females into the tech industry.
