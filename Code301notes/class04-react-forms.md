# Readings: React and Forms

## Article - Forms

- Forms in HTML usually maintain their own state and update it based on user input
- Forms in React typically have state updated with `setState()`

- These 2 ways can be combined so the React state is the "single source of truth"
  - React component will render a form and also controls what happens in the form with user input
