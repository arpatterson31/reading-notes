## HTML Chapter 7: Forms

HTML can create forms to collect information from visitors to your site. 


### Form Controls:
- Adding text
  - text input - single line or multi-line
  - password input
- making choices
  - radio buttons - user must select one of a number of options
  - checkboxes - user can select and unselect one or more options
  - drop-down boxes - user must pick one of a number of options from a list
- submitting forms
  - submit buttons
  - image buttons - similar to submit but allows you to use an image 
- uploading files
  - file upload


### How Forms work

1. user fills in a form and presses a button to submit the info to the server
2. the name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user entered
3. server processes the information using a programming language
4. server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received


### HTML Structure

`<form>`

`action` - every form requires an action. It's value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the info in the form when it is submitted

`method` - get or post - form can be sent using on of those 2 methods

- get method examples: search boxes or short forms
- post method examples: uploading files, or contains sensitive data like passwords, or adds info to a database


`<form action="https://www.url.com" method="get"></form>`
