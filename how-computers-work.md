# How Computers work

- Input - this is what you do to tell the computer to do stuff
- storage - stores input
- processing
- output - what you requested through the input

## Binary and data

- images are made up pixels...which are made up of colors...which can be represented by number code -- translated into binary!
- videos are a lot of images which then follow the same pattern
- sound - sound vibration on a graph -- represented by numbers - more bits higher range of number - better quality
