# Class 5 Reading Notes - HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Images

Images can either make your site look average or really engaging so choosing the right ones are key!


Images should:
- be relevant
- convey information
- convey the right mood
- be instantly recognizable
- fit the color palette

**All images are subject to copyright so don't steal other people's work!**

Adding an image:
- use `<img>` tag - no need for closing tag
- `src` tells the browser where the file is located
- `alt` provides a text description
- `title` provides additional information about the image
