# Class 4 Reading Notes - HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links

**Links** allow you to move from one page/place to another - browsing the web

Types of Links
- One website to another 
- from one page to another on the same website
- from one part of the page to another but on the same page
- ones that open into a new browser window
- ones that start up another program like your email

Links are created using an anchor tag: `<a></a>`

How to write links:

- Linking to another website: `<a href="url that you want the link to take you to">TEXT</a>`
- other page on same site: `<a href="index.html">TEXT</a>`
  - for pages in folders or directories, make sure to reference the folder structure
- Email Links: `<a href="mailto:name@example.com">EMAIL</a>`
- Open new window: `<a href="www.url.com" target="_blank">TEXT</a>`
