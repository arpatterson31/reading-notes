# CSS learning notes

CSS adds style!

## CSS Rules
 - Contains 2 parts
   - selector or the element -- like h1, p, body
   - declaration - how it will be styled -- font, color, size
     - declarations are broken out into a property and a value
        - the property is the name of the style -- font, color, size

Example of how CSS looks:
``` p {```   
            ```color: red;}```    


### External CSS & Internal CSS
 - External is linked using ``` <link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">```
    - Advantage: less code and smaller html pages, all pages can share the same stylesheet - preferred
 - Internal is using ``` <style> ``` html tag 
    - Advantage: everything is in one place, could work best when creating only page
