# CSS learning notes

CSS adds style!

## CSS Rules
 - Contains 2 parts
   - selector or the element -- like h1, p, body
   - declaration - how it will be styled -- font, color, size
     - declarations are broken out into a property and a value
        - the property is the name of the style -- font, color, size
